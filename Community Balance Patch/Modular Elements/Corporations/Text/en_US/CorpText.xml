By the time of Justinian (reigned 527–565), Roman Law recognized a range of corporate entities under the names universitas, corpus or collegium. These included the state itself (the populus Romanus), municipalities, and such private associations as sponsors of a religious cult, burial clubs, political groups, and guilds of craftsmen or traders. Such bodies commonly had the right to own property and make contracts, to receive gifts and legacies, to sue and be sued, and, in general, to perform legal acts through representatives.

Economic transnationalism, commonly known as Globalization, was spurred in the latter half of the 20th century by the development of the internet and wireless communication, as well as the reduction in global transportation costs caused by containerization. Multinational corporations could be seen as a form of transnationalism, in that they seek to minimize costs, and hence maximize profits, by organizing their operations in the most efficient means possible irrespective of political boundaries.</Text>

			<Text>National syndicalism is an adaptation of syndicalism to suit the social agenda of integral nationalism. National syndicalism suggests that the people must defend themselves through the development of Syndicalist sections into massive economic worker movements. These should take immediate action to expropriate the capitalists. These should also take direct action to let the workers lead the production and to form peoples communes. National syndicalism seeks out principled reasons for direct economic action and denounces parliamentary action by representatives. The goal is not to make capitalism bearable, but the realisation of a free Nationalist and Socialist nation. National syndicalism aims to move the attention from the political terrain to the economic terrain. It wants the socialisation from the basis: a system of distribution from local units, in consultation with the National federation, on the fundament of a production and consumption statistic. As well as the organisation of the production by national industrial federations.</Text>
